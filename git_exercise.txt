Used git on personal repo
Master
Development
And various feature branches

Update branch, push, merge with a PR
Dev into master
Feature to dev, dev to master

Pulled remote feature branch(from another developer) into local 
Development branch

Setup some git aliases on Windows

Added several files to the repo from den pc to Mac


Created feature branch, made changes, push to remote, PR/merged
Checkout dev, git pull origin dev to get changes


Deleted remote.   Git push origin --delete <branch name>
Deleted local	  git branch -d <branch name>

Still need to work thru a merge example

Here is a big issue: Life
